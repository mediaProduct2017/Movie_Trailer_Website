# Movie_Trailer_Website
This project is used to produce a website for a list of movie trailers.

## Getting started
You need to install [python](https://www.python.org/) first to run this project. To get started, clone the Movie_Trailer_Website repository to work on this project locally on your computer.

    $ git clone https://github.com/mediaProduct2017/Movie_Trailer_Website.git

## Usage
Open the directory 'Moive_Trailer_Website' and run the script 'entertainment_center.py'.

    $ cd Movie_Trailer_Website
    $ python entertainment_center.py
  
Then you'll see a html file called 'fresh_tomatoes.html' in the directory and it will be opened in your browser.


In the website, you can hit one of the movie poster images, and its trailer will be played.
